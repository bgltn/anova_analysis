Diamond Price Analysis Using ANOVA

Project Overview
This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that demonstrates the use of ANOVA (Analysis of Variance) 
to explore how different factors such as the color and cut of diamonds affect their market prices. 

The analysis aims to provide insights that can help in decision-making for businesses involved in the trading and valuation of diamonds.

Features

1. Data Exploration: Initial exploration of the 'diamonds' dataset from the seaborn library.
2. One-Way ANOVA: Analysis to determine how much the color of diamonds affects their price.
3. Two-Way ANOVA: Investigation of the interaction effects between color and cut on diamond prices.
4. Post-hoc Analysis: Utilizing Tukey HSD to understand specific group differences.
